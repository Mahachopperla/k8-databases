#backend components doesn't require statefulset , they need deployment only
#but let's create autoscaling policy for backend application
# 2 things need to check before going to create autoscaling policy

# 1. make sure metrics server is running - there will be metrics server created automatically when u create a kubernates cluster
# 			- to verify go to cluster in aws portal and - choose add-ons then u can see metrics server under add-ons
# 		2. we should mention resources requests and limits in pods - so that pod can track the usage limits of metrics like cpu and memory
		
#     if these 2 checks are done then we can crete autoscaling policy for our backend applications
